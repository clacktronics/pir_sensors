pir_sensors
===========

Theese are housings for minature PIR sensors you can purchase from many ebay sellers. Designed for 3d Printing. They have a tube that is over the PIR lens so that they can be used like beams you can break.
side_mount = PIR sensor is parallel to the wall 
protrude = PIR  is 90 degrees to the wall sticking out from it
intrude = PIR  is 90 degrees to the wall embedded in it

currently there is a little bit of work needed to make theese better
